# Tk-Wikipedia-Demo

## Synopsis

This project contains [code](https://github.com/sleutho/Tk-Wikipedia-Demo/blob/master/demo.tcl) to generate a [Tk GUI](http://www.tcl.tk/) that demonstrates most Tk features for the screenshot seen on the [Tk Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software)) page. It only tries to show the widgets, without further binding and event handling.
